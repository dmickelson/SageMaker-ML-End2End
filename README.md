# SageMaker-ML-End2End
 Leveraging the power of AWS Sagemaker to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle.
 
 ## How to Productionalize your ML Model ##

 An example of how to take your model that you have created in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab into Production environment.
 
 This code will create a Learning Pipeline, a modular, reproducable, scalable, sequence of operations from within AWS SageMaker to transform raw data into actionable insights.
 
 This will show how to deploy your ML project into AWS SageMaker, using its pre-built modules to execute the pipeline.
 
 This code assumes you know how to access you AWS environment from the Console, and basic AWS SageMaker knowledge on how to start a SageMaker Domain, and start a Notebook instance.
 
 * Load or Copy the Notebook code into the AWS SageMaker Studio Jupter Lab to execute on the AWS Cloud infrastructure.
